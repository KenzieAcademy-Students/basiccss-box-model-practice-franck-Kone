This box should have a lightblue background. 
It should be 100px tall. 
The text should be centered. 
There should be no space between the box and the edge of the window on the top, left, and right sides. */

This box should have a lightcyan background. 
It should be 100px tall. 
The text should be centered, both horizontally and vertically. 
There should be 100 pixels of space on either side of the box: left and right. 
There should be 20 pixels of space on either side of the box: top and bottom. 
Hint: There are a few ways to center a single line of text vertically. This could use padding, or you can use the line-height property for text. Both can work, but quickly google both ways to make sure you understand them. */

/* Box Three 
This box should have a rgb(32, 178, 170) background. 
This box should be 500px wide. 
This box should be as tall as 20% of the total height of the entire view. 
This box should be horizontally centered. 
The text should be on the right side, with 10px between the text and the edges of the box. 
Hint: When setting the height of the box, 20% won't work because the % unit is relative to the parent container. Right now the parent container is the body tag, but the body tag does not have any height! However, there is another CSS unit to help with this that has to do with the "viewport height"... Google for it. */

Reflection Each activity,
weâ€™ll try to give you something a little extra to think about. Write a short response to this question: 

What is the difference between the padding and the margin? How do those relate to both the border and the inner content?
